00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.160
This is Qun Qun Rinapon, a.k.a. Inoue Rina! 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.600
Today, I’m visiting Bayside Place in Hakata.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.160
Actually, I haven’t had many chances to come to Bayside Place before.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.820
So while I’m really excited, reporting all by myself has me a bit nervous.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.940
[But I’m gonna do my best to stay super positive today!…]

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.520
And with that said…

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.600
Let’s go!

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.760
OK!

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.360
We’re here at Wangan Ichiba.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.920
Let’s head on in!

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.300
Does Wangan (“coast”) mean Japan?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.780
This market is quintessential Japan.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.060
Much of the fish sold here was caught here in the Hakata area.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.620
Which is your store’s most popular item?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.620
That would be our mackerel fillet.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.520
Wow! It’s so shiny...

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
<b>...it’s hard to believe it’s a dead fish</b>.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.900
Yes, well we take very fresh fish and dry it immediately,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.480
so it looks much different than your average mackerel.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.240
This way you really get the <b>aji (taste)</b> of the <b>aji (mackerel</b>).

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.180
The aji has a lot of aji.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.420
Nice one lady!

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.380
“Tempura at the market.”

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.860
“We’re open for…” ? (akinai= business) 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.660
Let’s go…

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.820
Chirin, chirin (ring ring)

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880
Excuse me!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.120
Hello.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.200
Um, it’s a big request, but…

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.280
I’ll fry something up for you now.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
Really, is that okay?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.620
I didn’t even say anything and he know what I wanted.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.880
Let’s dig in!

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.560
These are like “wait carrots can taste this good?” level carrots.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.380
This is their popular menu item, the “Wangan set.”

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.080
Shrimp, squid, eel, and lots of veggies.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.920
Thanks for the meal!

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.940
Ah, hello.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.100
Hello.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.900
You seem young.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.060
I’m 20.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.420
Wow that’s pretty young to have a fish shop.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.420
…

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.900
Do you have any recommendations for fish today?

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.460
Actually, we’re kind of low on stock today.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.580
Oh really.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.160
Are these fish originally so shiny?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.780
Are they dipped in something?

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.900
Oh no they’re not dipped in anything.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.400
But to keep them from drying out we have them in plastic wrap.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.840
Also I was wondering, was this <i>squid</i> always this color?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.920
That’s <i>octopus</i>.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.380
Hmm. Ok well sorry for taking so much of your time.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.380
You can get back to work.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.940
Thank you very much!

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.480
I kept him all to myself.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.360
Next time, Rinapon’s going to the aquarium!

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.940
Stay tuned!
